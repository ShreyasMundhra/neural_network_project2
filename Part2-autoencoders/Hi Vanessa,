Hi Vanessa,

Thank you for getting back to me.  While I was disappointed, I appreciate you taking the time to consider me as a candidate.  Knowing how professionally and thoroughly each candidate was interviewed, and having made it to the shortlisted, I am honored to have been involved and made it to the shortlist.

It was a pleasure to be an intern at Google Sydney and grow my soft and technical skills together with my team. I am very grateful for all the guidance and the knowledge that have been imparted, including the mentorships, the code reviews <3 , and many more. Experiencing all these Googley experiences makes me strengthen my dream to become a better software engineer in the future :D

I wish you and Google a continued success. Thank you for all your efforts on my behalf.

Regards,


It makes me strengthen my intention to continue pursuing a career as a software engineer in the future :D



to grow and develop my software engineering skills together with my team mentors and the code reviews :) I really enjoyed the time during my internship
